# Python Data Processing Project

## Overview

This project is designed as a practice exercise for Python programming, focusing on data processing using the Pandas library. The main goal was to work with multiple datasets to perform various operations such as merging, aggregation, and data cleaning.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Data Loading**: Successfully loaded multiple Excel files containing account and transaction information.
2. **Data Merging**: Merged datasets to enrich the main task data with additional account details.
3. **Duplicate Handling**: Identified and removed duplicate entries based on transaction IDs to ensure data integrity.
4. **Aggregation**: Calculated maximum, minimum, total, count, and average amounts by payment type to derive useful insights.
5. **Data Validation**: Implemented cross-checks to verify the correctness of the merged data and the absence of duplicates.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Excel

## Purpose

This project serves as a practical exercise to enhance my data manipulation skills in Python, particularly with the Pandas library, and to better understand how to handle real-world data challenges.
